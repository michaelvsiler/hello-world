# hello-world
This is my repository. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My repository is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my repository is useless. Without my repository, I am useless. I must fire my repository true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my repository and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.
